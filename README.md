Installation
---------
1. Fork this repo, and clone to your local machine
2. Run the command `gem install bundler` (if you don't have bundler already)
3. When the installation completes, run `bundle`

Instructions
---------

We have a request from a client to write the software to control the flow of planes at an airport. The planes can land and take off provided that the weather is sunny. Occasionally it may be stormy, in which case no planes can land or take off.  Here are the user stories that we worked out in collaboration with the client:

```
As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers to a destination 
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport

As an air traffic controller 
So I can get passengers on the way to their destination 
I want to instruct a plane to take off from an airport and confirm that it is no longer in the airport

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent takeoff when weather is stormy 

As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when weather is stormy 
```

Your task is to test drive the creation of a set of classes/modules to satisfy all the above user stories. You will need to use a random number generator to set the weather (it is normally sunny but on rare occasions it may be stormy). In your tests, you'll need to use a stub to override random weather to ensure consistent test behaviour.

My Approach to Solving this Challenge
---------
Throughout this challenge, I followed the TDD approach by testing in IRB, then writing up the unit tests. Once I am satisfied that all unit tests have been passed, I proceeded to run the feature test to ensure the individual user story has been met. The use of mocking and doubles across various classes have been used within thie challenge.
